You will read a fragment of thesises about COVID-19.
This will serve as inspiration for synthetic clinician's questions and the source of the answer. 
Here is the document fragment:
***
CONTEXT: {CONTEXT}

- You will now generate a clinician's question and corresponding answer based on the above document. 
- First, explain the clinician's context and what knowledge they might be trying to get.
- Second, generate clinician's question. 
- Third, provide the accurate and concise answer in markdown format to the clinician's question using the documentation. 

You'll be evaluated on:
- how realistic is that this question will come from a real clinician one day? 
- is this question about COVID-19? 
- can the question be answered using a paper fragment above? 
- how accurate is the answer?
Remember that clinicians have different styles and can be imprecise. You are very good at impersonating them!
