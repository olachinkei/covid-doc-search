Aims/Introduction :To assess the association of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus and its
acute-to-chronic glycemic ratio with clinical outcome in patients hospitalized with
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) using a la rge-scale nationwide registry in Japan.
Materials and Methods :Overall, 4,747 patients were included between July 2021 and
January 2022. We evaluated blo od glucose and glycated hemo globin levels at admission,
and calculated the acute-to-chronic glycemic ratio for each non-diabetes mellitus,
undiagnosed diabetes mellitus and pre-exis ting diabetes mellitus group. The primary
composite outcome comprised in-hospital mortality, invasive mechanical ventilation,extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support , intensive care unit admission and transfer
to a more advanced medical facility.
Results :Compared with the non-diabetes mellitus group, the undiagnosed diabetes
mellitus group was significantly associated with a worse COVID-19 outcome (odds ratio
2.18, 95% confidence interval 1.50 –3.18). In patients with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus,
the 3rd tertile of the acute-to-chronic glycemic ratio was linked with a worse COVID-19
outcome compared with the 1st tertile (odd s ratio 3.33, 95% confidence interval 1.43 –
7.77), whereas glycated hemog lobin levels were not; among patients with pre-existing
diabetes mellitus, glycated hemoglobin levels were linked with a worse outcome.
Conclusions :Among patients with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus with COVID-19, the
magnitude of elevation of blood glucose from chronic to acute levels is associated withworse outcomes.
INTRODUCTION
The complications of diabetes mellitus and hyperglycemia at
admission are known risk factors for worse outcomes with thecoronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19)
1. Emerging evidence
regarding the association between diabetes and COVID-19,including our previous study, shows that the prognosis is poorin patients with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus at admission,
which accounts for 15 –30% of the patients with diabetes melli-
tus hospitalized for COVID-19

MATERIALS AND METHODS
Study design
The present retrospective observational study used the datafrom the COVID-19 Registry Japan (COVIREGI-JP), a large-scale registry of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 inJapan
10. The healthcare facilities vo luntarily participating in the
registry enrolled the patients. The inclusion criteria for enroll-ment were a positive severe acute respiratory syndrome coron-avirus 2 test and inpatient treatment at a healthcare facility.
The study data were collected and managed using REDCap
(Research Electronic Data Capture), a secure, web-based datacapture application hosted at Joint Center for Researchers,Associates and Clinicians data center of the National Center forGlobal Health and Medicine. As of January 2022, >740 facilities
across Japan joined the registry, enrolling >57,000 patients with
COVID-19. We extracted data from the registry on age, sex,smoking history, vaccination, body mass index (BMI), medica-
tion, comorbidity, laboratory ﬁndings and outcomes. Comor-
bidities were scored with the Charlson Comorbidity Index,which encompasses 19 medical conditions, assembled by Charl-son et al.
11The study protocol was approved by the National
Center for Global Health and Medicine ethics review commit-tee (NCGM-G-003494-0). In addition, the present study wascarried out following the principles of the Declaration of Hel-sinki. The STROBE-statement of this study is shown in
Appendix S1.
Patients and de ﬁnition of outcomes
In the analysis, we included patients enrolled in the
COVIREGI-JP who tested positive for severe acute respiratorysyndrome coronavirus 2 and were hospitalized between 1 July2021 and 31 January 2022. However, patients aged <18 years,
with a history of using steroids for >1 month, pregnant,transferred from another hospital, un ﬁnalized data, or incom-
plete data on outcomes or glycemic pro ﬁles were excluded; we
then carried out complete data analyses.
The enrolled patients were categorized into the following
three groups: non-diabetes mellitus, undiagnosed diabetes melli-
tus and pre-existing diabetes mell itus. The undiagnosed diabetes
mellitus was de ﬁned as patients having HbA1c ≥6.5%
(48 mmol/mol) without a prior history of diabetes mellitus.Conversely, pre-existing diabetes mellitus was determined basedon self-reported history of diabetes mellitus, previous medicalrecords before admission, reported diagnosis of diabetes melli-tus or treatment with glucose-lowering medications. The
HbA1c data were measured at admission.
In addition, patients were strati ﬁed according to their respec-
tive tertiles of blood glucose and A/C glycemic ratio at admis-sion among all patients complicated with diabetes mellitus(excluding the non-diabetes mellitus group). The A/C glycemicratio was calculated based on the following formula

RESULTS
Among 9,631 patients hospitalized between 1 July 2021 and 31January 2022, a total of 4,747 patients were included in theanalysis (Figure 1), of which the non-diabetes mellitus, undiag-
nosed diabetes mellitus and pre-existing diabetes mellitusgroups comprised 3,722 (78.4%), 287 (6.0%) and 738 (15.5%)patients, respectively. Notably, patients with undiagnosed dia-betes mellitus accounted for 27.2% (287/1,055) of all the
patients with diabetes mellitus. Tables 1and 2presents the
baseline characteristics and outcomes. Overall, the primary out-come event was recorded in 189 (5.1%), 47 (16.4%) and 115(15.6%) patients in the non-diabetes mellitus, undiagnosed dia-betes mellitus and pre-existing diabetes mellitus groups, respec-tively.

DISCUSSION
Theﬁndings of the present study showed that the undiagnosed
diabetes mellitus group, as well as the pre-existing diabetes mel-
litus group, was associated with worse COVID-19 outcomescompared to the non-diabetes mellitus group. In addition, inpatients with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, the A/C glycemicratio was associated with a poor prognosis, whereas HbA1clevels were unrelated to the ou tcome. Conversely, in patients
with pre-existing diabetes mellitus, HbA1c levels, rather thanthe A/C glycemic ratio, were associated with severe outcomes
of COVID-19. To the best of our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst
study to investigate the value of the A/C glycemic ratio inde-pendently for patients with undi agnosed diabetes mellitus and
pre-existing diabetes mellitus. At the same time, previousreports have examined the usefulness of the parameters of acutehyperglycemia in patients with diabetes mellitus as a whole
5,6,9.
Although an association between undiagnosed diabetes melli-
tus and poor prognosis has been reported in patients with
COVID-19, a relatively small number of patients were reported
in these studies2,13,14. The present study results corroborated
this association by utilizing an ex tensive national registry. Addi-
tionally, the result that undiagno sed diabetes mellitus accounted
for 27.2% of diabetes mellitus is closely comparable with ourpast single-center study result of 30.6%
2, which is higher than
the previous meta-analysis result of 14.4%5. Differences in the
study duration and geography in these studies might have
affected the prevalence of undiagnosed diabetes mellitus; never-
theless, the potentially high majority of patients with undiag-nosed diabetes mellitus reinforces the importance of screeningfor diabetes mellitus on admission.
Furthermore, the present data showed that in patients with
undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, the higher the A/C glycemicratio, which implies a greater magnitude of baseline chronic to
subsequent acute blood glucose elevation, the poorer the prog-nosis of COVID-19. In patients wi th undiagnosed diabetes mel-
litus who had COVID-19, stress-induced transient insulinresistance and acute insulin de ﬁciency have been indicated as

association between acute hyperglycemia and poor outcome of
COVID-19 has not been fully elucidated, the potential causativefactors include reduced host cellular defenses due to alteredleukocyte function, activation of nuclear factor κB, and mito-
chondrial and vascular endothel ial dysfunction by oxidative
stress
3,18. In patients with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus, these
acute pathologies might have also been linked with a poorerprognosis. Furthermore, levels of in ﬂammatory cytokines, such
as interleukin-6 and tumor necrosis factor- α, are typically ele-
vated in patients with severe COVID-19
17,19.T h e s ec y t o k i n e s
might deteriorate β-cell function and insulin resistance, and
potentially result in hyperglycemia20. Unfortunately, as the pre-
sent data did not include these exploratory biomarkers, furtherstudies are required to consider the effects of cytokines andacute stress on hyperglycemia and the prognosis of COVID-19in patients with undiagnosed diabetes mellitus. Additionally,
whether the alterations in glucose metabolism that abruptly
developed in severe COVID-19 are long-lasting or temporaryremains unclear
21. Our COVID-19 registry does not contain
long-term glucose metabolism status and thus cannot con-tribute to this vital issue.
We found that HbA1c levels at admission were associated with
worse COVID-19 outcomes in patients with pre-existing diabetesmellitus. These different results between the patients with undiag-

"In addition to COVID-19, undiag nosed diabetes mellitus is
also known to be associated with poor outcomes in patientswith acute stroke and myocardial infarction
22,23; however,
whether the mechanism is stress-induced hyperglycemia or
caused by other pathologies remains controversial. Furthermore,
a previous study reported the prognostic impact of a high A/Cratio in patients with diabetes me llitus hospitalized with acute
myocardial infarction
9. Therefore, to elucidate the effects of
sudden acute glycemic change on severe illness in patients withundiagnosed diabetes mellitus, future studies should assess thecorrelation between the A/C glycemic ratio and prognosis.
The present study had some limitations. First, there were no
data on blood glucose levels after admission, which made it
impossible to assess the duration of the hyperglycemia duringhospitalization. Second, as only hospitalized patients withCOVID-19 were included, patients who were recuperating athome or in a hotel were not assessed in this study. Third,because physicians at each facility decide the treatment regimenand intensive care unit admission, it cannot be ruled out thatthe treatment differences between facilities might have affected
the results.
In conclusion, we showed that among patients with undiag-
nosed diabetes mellitus who had COVID-19, the magnitude ofthe elevation of blood glucose from chronic to acute levels islinked with worse COVID-19 outcomes. Therefore, assessingthe A/C glycemic ratio would be bene ﬁcial in patients with
undiagnosed diabetes mellitus rather than independently evalu-ating blood glucose and HbA1c levels. We also re-emphasize
the importance of glycemic control in the daily care of patients
with pre-existing diabetes mellitus.

Influenza ABSTRACT  
Rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) significantly impact disease treatment strategy. In Japan, information on the use of 
RDTs for patients with COVID-19 is limited. Here, we aimed to investigate the RDT implementation rate, 
pathogen detection rate, and clinical characteristics of patients positive for other pathogens by using COVIREGI- 
JP, a national registry of hospitalized patients with COVID-19. 
A total of 42,309 COVID-19 patients were included. For immunochromatographic testing, influenza was the 
most common (n =2881 [6.8%]), followed by Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n =2129 [5%]) and group A strepto -

and for 5326 patients (12.6%) for L. pneumophila . 
The completion rate of M. pneumonia loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) testing was low (n =97 
[0.2%]). FilmArray RP was performed in 372 (0.9%) patients; 1.2% (36/2881) of patients were positive for 
influenza, 0.9% (2/223) for the respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), 9.6% (205/2129) for M. pneumoniae , and 7.3% 
(27/372) for GAS. The positivity rate for urine antigen testing was 3.3% (183/5524) for S. pneumoniae and 0.2% 
(13/5326) for L. pneumophila . The positivity rate for LAMP test was 5.2% (5/97) for M. pneumoniae . Five of 372 
patients (1.3%) had positive FilmArray RP, with human enterovirus being the most frequently detected (1.3%, 5/ 
372). 
The characteristics of patients with and without RDTs submission and positive and negative results differed for 
each pathogen. RDTs remain an important diagnostic tool in patients with COVID-19 in whom coinfection with 
other pathogens needs to be tested based on clinical evaluation.   
Although coinfections with other pathogens are rare in patients with 
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), there is evidence of a possible 
association of coinfection with severe COVID-19 [1]. RDTs are consid -
ered important in determining treatment strategies in the early stages of 
the disease. In Japan, information is limited on the use of RDTs in pa-
tients with COVID-19 [2]. We aimed to investigate RDT implementation 
rates, pathogen detection rates, and clinical characteristics of positive patients with other pathogens using COVIREGI-JP [3], a national reg-
istry of hospitalized patients with COVID-19.

uated. Each pathogen was counted separately for positive results of 
multiple pathogens from a single patient. The epidemic waves were 
defined as follows: first wave (Wave 1): 01/01/2020 –05/31/2020, 
second wave (Wave 2): 06/01/2020 –10/31/2020, third wave (Wave 3): 
11/01/2020 –03/31/2021, and fourth wave (Wave 4): 04/01/2021 –06/ 
30/2021. Severity on admission was defined as previously reported [4]. 
Nominal variables were compared using Fisher ’s exact or Pearson ’s 
chi-square tests. Continuous variables were compared using the Man-
n–Whitney U test. All p values were two-tailed, and p <0.05 was 
considered statistically significant. To compare the characteristics of 
patients with and without rapid diagnostic test submission, Dunnett ’s 
method was used for pairwise comparisons between patients with and 
without rapid diagnostic test submission (threshold of significant dif-
ference was 0.01). All analyses were performed using SPSS version 27 
(IBM Corporation, Armonk, NY, USA). This study was approved by the 
National Center for Global Health and Medicine ethics review commit -
tee (NCGM-G-003494-0). 
A total of 42,309 COVID-19 patients were included. The number of 
males was 24,908 (57.0%), with a median age of 59 years (interquartile 
range [IQR] 41–75). Test for influenza by immunochromatography 
method was performed most commonly (n =2881 [6.8%]), followed by 
tests for Mycoplasma pneumoniae (n =2129 [5%]) and Streptococcus 
pyogenes [Group A Streptococcus: (GAS)] (n =372 [0.9%]). RSV, 
adenovirus, and human metapneumovirus (HMPV) test implementation 
rates were all less than 0.5% (Table 1). Urine antigen testing was per-
formed for S. pneumoniae in 5524 (13.1%) patients and for 
L. pneumophila in 5326 patients (12.6%). The completion rate of LAMP 
testing was low (e.g. M. pneumoniae : n =97 [0.2%]). FilmArray RP was 
performed in 372 (0.9%) patients. Positivity rates of the immunochromatographic test were 1.2% (36/2881) for influenza, 0.9% 
(2/223) for RSV, 9.6% (205/2129) for M. pneumoniae , and 7.3% (27/ 
372) for GAS. The positivity rate for the urine antigen test was 3.3% 
(183/5524) for S. pneumoniae and 0.2% (13/5326) for L. pneumophila . 
Positivity rate for the LAMP test was 5.2% (5/97) for M. pneumoniae . 
L. pneumophila was negative in all 36 patients. FilmArray RP was posi-
tive for five of 372 patients (1.3%) and human enterovirus was the most 
frequently detected (1.3%, 5/372). 
We then compared the characteristics of patients with and without 
RDT presentation (Table 2). Patients with RDT test submission were 
generally older than patients without, except the GAS and 
M. pneumoniae groups. The use of invasive mechanical ventilation 
ECMO, or extracorporeal membranous oxygenation on admission was 
significantly higher in the patient with RDT test submission than pa-
tients without. 
Fever and fatigue were more frequent symptoms on admission in 
patients with RDT test submission than patients without. 
Cough and shortness of breath were more common in the patients 
with RDT test groups, except GAS, than patients without, whereas sore 
throat was more common in the patients with GAS test submission. 
Prevalence of comorbidity was higher in patients with RDT test sub-
mission than patients without, except those in the GAS test group. 
Subsequently, the characteristics of patients with positive and 
negative results for each test were compared (Table 3). Although there 
was no significant age difference between the influenza-positive and 
negative groups, the positive group had more symptoms of dysgeusia 
(27.8% [10/36] versus 11.5% [326/2840], p =0.006) and dysosmia 
(22.2% [8/36] versus 9.4% [266/2840], p =0.017) than the negative 
group. Patients with positive influenza test results had a higher rate of 
obesity than patients with negative test results (22.2% [8/36] versus

"group. Patients with positive influenza test results had a higher rate of
obesity than patients with negative test results (22.2% [8/36] versus 
6.8% [194/2840], p =0.003). There were no significant differences 
between positive and negative groups in the test group GAS. 
For M. pneumoniae , the positive group was significantly younger than 
the negative group (median age [IQR]: 35 [26–55] vs 57 [43–72], p <
0.001), and comorbidity tended to be lower in the positive group than in 
the negative group. Although the M. pneumoniae -positive group had 
significantly more symptoms on admission than the negative group, 
including dysgeusia (26.7% [56/210] vs. 14.5% [290/2000], p <0.001) 
and dysosmia (22.9% [48/210] vs. 12% [241/2000], p <0.001), fever 
was lower in the positive group than in the negative group (57.6% [121/ 
210] vs. 65.7% [1314/2000], p =0.022). The number of patients who 
were severely ill on admission was lower in the M. pneumoniae -positive 
group than in the negative group (17.6% [37/210] vs. 37.5% [750/ 
2000], p <0.001). The prevalence of pneumonia identified by radio -
logical testing was also lower in the positive group than in the negative 
group (75.6% [136/210] vs 87.3% [1621/2000], p <0.001). 
For S. pneumoniae , the positive group was older (median age [IQR]: 
70 [43–83] vs. 59 [45–73], p <0.001) and had a lower proportion of 
males than did the negative group (47.3% [86/183] vs 62.7% [3344/ 
5341], p <0.001). Positive patients were more likely to have the 
symptom of wet cough on admission than negative patients (49.5% [46/ 
183] vs 33.2% [913/5341], p =0.002). The prevalence of patients 
without comorbidity was lower in patients with positive S. pneumoniae 
test results than in patients with negative results (6.0% [11/183] vs 
10.7% [569/5341], p =0.049). 
In L. pneumophila , all patients with positive test results had pneu-
monia on computed tomography. The prevalence of leukemia and hy-
pertension tended to be higher in the group with positive L. pneumophila 
tests than in the negative group. 
We also compared test completion rates and positivity rates between 
pandemic waves (Supplementary Table 1). Rapid tests for influenza, 
GAS, M. pneumoniae , and urine antigens (S. pneumoniae and 
L. pneumophila ) were all performed at the highest rates in Wave 1. 
Positivity for M. pneumoniae and S. pneumoniae was the highest in Wave 
2 and lowest in Wave 4. No apparent difference was observed for 
L. pneumophila between waves. Table 1

What is the LAMP test and can it be used to diagnose COVID-19?
","
The LAMP test, or loop-mediated isothermal amplification, is a molecular diagnostic technique used to detect the presence of specific DNA sequences. While it is not commonly used for COVID-19 diagnosis, some studies have shown that it can be a useful tool for detecting the virus. However, further research is needed to determine its accuracy and reliability compared to other diagnostic methods such as RT-PCR. The document fragment does not provide information on whether the patient was tested for COVID-19 using the LAMP test.",originaldoc/Characteristics-of-hospitalized-COVID-19-patients.pdf	 page(2),"The LAMP test is a loop-mediated isothermal amplification test that is used as a rapid diagnostic test for various respiratory pathogens, including COVID-19.

What are the differences in clinical characteristics between patients who were tested for COVID-19 using a rapid diagnostic test and those who were not?
","
The document fragment provides a comparison of characteristics of patients with and without rapid diagnostic test submission for various respiratory infections, including COVID-19. The table shows that there were 2881 patients who were tested for COVID-19 using a rapid diagnostic test and 39,428 patients who were not. Patients who were tested using a rapid diagnostic test were older (median age of 62 vs. 58), more likely to be male (63.9% vs. 56.5%), and had a longer onset to admission time (median of 5 days vs. 4 days) compared to those who were not tested using a rapid diagnostic test. There were no significant differences in the proportion of patients with pneumonia on admission or in the severity of illness on admission between the two groups.",originaldoc/Characteristics-of-hospitalized-COVID-19-patients.pdf	 page(3),"According to a study published in the Journal of Infection and Chemotherapy, the characteristics of patients with and without rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) submission and positive and negative results differed for each pathogen. RDTs remain an important diagnostic tool in patients with COVID-19 in whom coinfection with other pathogens needs to be tested based on clinical evaluation. However, the study did not specifically compare the clinical characteristics of patients who were tested for COVID-19 using a rapid diagnostic test and those who were not.",CORRECT

These include myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, severe DM, obesity, and hypertension.",originaldoc/Characteristics-of-hospitalized-COVID-19-patients.pdf	 page(4),"Several factors predispose patients to severe disease and death from COVID-19, including advanced age, obesity, and underlying diseases. A large registry study suggested that scoring risk factors from patient backgrounds can predict prognosis in COVID-19 patients. In addition, patients with severe disease are more likely to have decreased lymphocyte counts and elevated levels of enzymes, inflammatory markers, and D-dimer. Some previous studies have also focused on novel biomarkers, such as soluble urokinase receptors and C-reactive protein isoforms. However, the strongest predictor of prognosis of COVID-19 is serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) level one week after admission. Elevated serum LDH at initial presentation has been shown to strongly influence progression to respiratory failure and death.",CORRECT

Results are presented as number (%) unless otherwise specified. If more than one microbiological test was submitted per person, each test was considered separately. For positive results of multiple pathogens from a single 
patient, each pathogen was counted separately. 
#p values were calculated for the comparison of characteristics of patients with and without rapid diagnostic test submission. Nominal variables were compared using Fisher ’s exact test. Continuous variables were 
compared using the Mann –Whitney U test. Dunnett ’s method was used for pairwise comparisons (threshold of significant difference was 0.01). 
A. Eight patients were excluded because gender was unknown. 
B. Radiograph was not obtained in 12,308 cases; CT scan was not obtained in 12,273 cases. 
C. For Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Legionella pneumophila , Rapid kit test and LAMP test were combined for the analysis. If tests were duplicated (i.e. both Rapid kit test and LAMP tests were submitted), then, one test was 
counted.

545In this study, we determined the actual situation of RDT use in 
COVID-19 hospitalized patients in Japan. Regarding test implementa -
tion rates, the immunochromatographic test for influenza (6.8%), M. 
pneumoniae (5.0%), and a urine antigen test (S. pneumonia: 13.1%, 
L. pneumophila: 12.6%) were performed more often than other RDTs. 
Test completion rates were high in Wave 1 and tended to decline 
thereafter, although, for influenza, there was a trend toward more 
testing in Wave 3 than in Waves 2 and 4. This result is likely because 
Wave 3 occurred in winter. Characteristics, such as symptoms or con-
ditions, of patients undergoing RDT differed. This suggests that physi -
cian judgment and individual facility practices influenced the decision 
to perform the test. During Wave 1, there were many unknowns, such as 
the frequency of coinfections, which would probably have triggered the 
high implementation rates of testing. According to the influenza sur-
veillance at designated institutions (excluding pediatric surveillance) in 
Japan, the positive rate of influenza-like illnesses (ILI) was 13.2% in the 
2018/2019 season, 7.9% in the 2019/2020 season, and 0% in the 2020/ 
2021 season (the diagnosis of influenza: 1.7%) [5]. The positive rate of 
influenza in our cohort in Wave 1 is lower than the ILI rate of influenza 
surveillance in the 2019/2020 season; contrarily, it was rather higher in 
our cohort in Wave 3 than it was in the influenza surveillance data from 
2020/2021 season. Because our cohort included patients with a 
confirmed COVID-19 diagnosis, the lower influenza-positive rate in our 
cohort than in the surveillance data should be considered reasonable. 
The opposite trend in 2020/2021 and Wave 3 might be influenced by 
situations such as the change in triage systems for patients with fever, 
which might have affected the patient population in surveillance in-
stitutions [6]. 
For M. pneumoniae, the immunochromatographic test had a higher 
positivity rate than LAMP. In the previous metanalysis, M. pneumoniae 
immunochromatographic test showed high specificity (0.92), with 
modest sensitivity (0.70) for the diagnosis of M. pneumoniae infection, 
suggesting that the false positive rate is low [7]. The discrepancy in 
M. pneumoniae-positive rates between immunochromatographic test and 
LAMP test can not be fully explained; one possible reason is the selection 
bias due to the participating facilities and the patients’ population. The 
positive rate of M. pneumoniae tests in Wave 2 and the positive rate of 
GAS in Wave 3 increased in our cohort but did not move in parallel with 
the number of national reports [8]. The different patient populations 
may have influenced these differences from national surveillance. Na-
tional surveillance data were collected from designated sentinel sites 
regardless of the status of COVID-19 infection, whereas our cohort was 
comprised of hospitalized COVID-19 patients, who are likely to be older 
and more comorbid than the general population. There is also a possi -
bility that an asymptomatic carrier was detected in our cohort. Dys-
geusia and dysosmia occurred more frequently in patients who tested 
positive for influenza and M. pneumoniae. Patients who tested positive 
for M. pneumoniae were younger than the overall cohort, who were more 
likely to complain of these symptoms [9]. Therefore, age may have had a 
confounding influence. However, there was no significant age difference 
between the positive and negative groups for influenza. Further studies 
are needed to evaluate the reproducibility of our findings in different 
cohorts of patients. The S. pneumoniae-positive group was characterized 
by older age, wet cough, and multiple underlying diseases, reflecting the 
characteristics of pneumococcal pneumonia. 
A limitation of this study is that the RDTs were submitted after cli-

A limitation of this study is that the RDTs were submitted after cli-

the interpretation of the positivity rate should be undertaken with 
caution. This study was based on RDT results recorded by each institu -
tion. Therefore, validation of test accuracy at each facility was not 
performed, and detailed information such as the product name of the kit 
used was also lacking. An assessment of the impact on inpatient treat-
ment and prognosis based on the identification of pathogens by RDTs is 
beyond the scope of this study and was not performed. 
Although the implementation rate of RDTs in hospitalized patients with COVID-19 showed a decreasing trend over time, there were still 
positive cases for other pathogens identified by RDTs. The patients with 
positive RDT results had different clinicoepidemiological characteristics 
than the negative patients. In conclusion, RDT remains an important 
diagnostic tool in patients with COVID-19 whose coinfection with other 
pathogens must be tested based on clinical evaluation.

SARS-CoV-2 ABSTRACT  
Background: Molnupiravir is being widely used as a treatment for coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19); how-
ever, its acceptability and safety in older patients aged ≥80 years in real-world clinical practice is not well 
understood. 
Methods: We conducted a single-centre retrospective study and assessed the outcome of patients with COVID-19 
treated with molnupiravir according to the following criteria: (A) discontinuation rate of molnupiravir; (B) type, 
frequency, and severity of adverse events; (C) all-cause mortality within 30 days of the diagnosis of COVID-19. 
Results: Forty-seven patients (46.1%) were aged ≥80 years (older patients) and 55 (53.9%) were aged <80 years 
(younger patients). There were no significant differences in coexisting diseases and history of vaccination for 
COVID-19 between older and younger patients. Older patients were significantly more likely to have moderate 
disease (moderate 1 and 2) according to the Japanese Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare classification than 
younger patients. During treatment, 8.5% of older patients and 1.8% of younger patients stopped taking mol-
nupiravir, but the difference was not significant. Adverse events were observed in 39/102 (38.2%) patients. The 
most common adverse events were diarrhoea (9.8%), exacerbation of coexisting diseases (6.9%), bone marrow 
suppression (6.9%), liver dysfunction (5.9%), and loss of appetite (4.9%). Most adverse events were minor, 
ranging from grades 1 to 3. The all-cause mortality rate was 10.8%, and no molnupiravir-related deaths were 
observed. 
Conclusions: Molnupiravir treatment is acceptable and safe in older patients with COVID-19 aged ≥80 years.   
1.Introduction 
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), caused by severe acute res-
piratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), had spread globally 
from Wuhan, China, at the end of 2019 and led to enormous medical, 
social, and economic impacts worldwide. As of September 2022, over 
612 million people have been diagnosed with COVID-19 worldwide, and 
approximately 6.5 million patients have died [1]. With the development 
of several vaccines and multiple treatments, the pandemic is nearing its end. As of November 2022, remdesivir, molnupiravir, and 
ritonavir-boosted nirmatrelvir have been approved and used worldwide 
as antiviral drugs against COVID-19 [2,3]. Molnupiravir, having activity 
against SARS-CoV-2, is a small-molecule ribonucleoside prodrug of 
N-hydroxycytidine that exerts its antiviral action by introducing copying

2clinical studies have shown that molnupiravir significantly reduces the 
risk of hospitalisation or death in high-risk patients with 
mild-to-moderate COVID-19 [7]. According to the latest Japanese 
COVID-19 treatment guidelines, patients who (a) had mild-to-moderate 
COVID-19, (b) were at risk of progressing to severe disease, and (c) were 
in the early stage from disease onset (within 5 days) were recommended 
to receive molnupiravir [8]. Japan is a hyper-aged society, and many 
patients with COVID-19 who are admitted to the hospital are older. Age 
is a risk factor for severe disease in older individuals, and antiviral 
treatment is recommended in this population. However, in clinical 
practice, there is little experience with the use of antiviral drugs in older 
individuals, and studies on their acceptability and safety are insufficient. 
In this retrospective study, we compared the acceptability and safety 
of molnupiravir in COVID-19 patients aged over and under 80 years. 
2.Methods 
2.1. Patients and methods 
This was a retrospective study conducted in the National Hospital 
Organization Kyoto Medical Centre (NHOKMC: Kyoto City, Japan). 
NHOKMC is located in the southern part of Kyoto City and serves as the 
core hospital for the region. It is a tertiary level medical institution that 
handles all levels of emergencies. At the request of the government, it 
established a ward dedicated to the management of patients with 
moderate to severe COVID-19. We retrospectively reviewed patients 
who received molnupiravir for the treatment of COVID-19. All patients 
who received molnupiravir at NHOKMC were included in the study, and 
there are no exclusion criteria. All patients were diagnosed with COVID- 
19 using polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based methods. Molnupiravir 
was locally available for prescription from 11 January 2022 in this 
hospital. The study period was from 11 January to 31 October 2022. 
The COVID-19 Registry Japan of the National Centre for Global 
Health and Medicine was used for the present study with permission. 
The study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic 
Data Capture, a secure web-based data capture application hosted at the 
JCRAC data centre of the National Centre for Global Health and 
Medicine. 
A standard dosage of 800 mg of molnupiravir was administered 
orally twice daily for 5 days. If oral intake was difficult, administration 
via nasogastric tube was attempted. 
The following data were collected: patient characteristics, medical 
history, date of COVID-19 diagnosis, severity of COVID-19, date of 
initiation of treatment with molnupiravir, number of days of molnu -
piravir treatment, concomitant medications for the treatment of COVID- 
19, complete blood cell count tests at the initiation of treatment, adverse 
events, discontinuation rate, and 30-day mortality rate. The discontin -
uation rate of molnupiravir was calculated based on patients who were 
unable to complete 5 days of oral medication for any reason, including 
adverse events or worsening of their condition. 
The severity of COVID-19 was recorded according to the Japanese 
Ministry of Health, Labour and Welfare (MHLW) criteria [8] and the 
National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Ordinal Scale 
(NIAID-OS) [9], while adverse events were assessed using the common 
terminology criteria for adverse events version 5.0 [10]. 
We assessed the outcome of patients with COVID-19 treated with 
molnupiravir according to the following criteria: (A) discontinuation 
rate of molnupiravir, (B) type, frequency, and severity of adverse events, 
and (C) all-cause mortality within 30 days of the diagnosis of COVID-19.

moderate disease (moderate 1 and 2) according to the Japanese MHLW 
classification than younger patients. There were no significant differ -
ences between the two groups in terms of the NIAID-OS classification. 
Table 2 shows the concomitant use of these drugs. In this study 
population, corticosteroids, sotrovimab, and tocilizumab were used 
concomitantly with molnupiravir. Corticosteroids were used in combi -
nation significantly more frequently in older patients than in younger 
patients (12.8% vs. 1.8%, P =0.046). During the course of treatment, 
8.5% of older patients and 1.8% of younger patients stopped taking 
molnupiravir, but there was no significant difference between the two 
groups. The reasons for discontinuation were worsening COVID-19 
status in three patients and dysgeusia in two patients. Two of the five 
patients who discontinued molnupiravir died, one from exacerbation of 
COVID-19 and the other from exacerbation of a coexisting disease. 
Adverse events were observed in 39/102 (38.2%) patients. There were 
no significant differences in the occurrence of adverse events between 
the older and younger patients. 
Table 3 shows the detailed profiles of the adverse events. A total of 
47 adverse events were observed in 39 COVID-19 patients. The most 
common adverse events, in order of frequency, were diarrhoea (9.8%), 
exacerbation of coexisting diseases (6.9%), bone marrow suppression 
(6.9%), liver dysfunction (5.9%), and loss of appetite (4.9%). Of the 47 
adverse events, 35 (74.5%) were minor, ranging from grades 1 to 3. 
Infection, exacerbation of coexisting diseases, and death were observed 
in 12 patients. However, there was no direct association between these 
adverse events and molnupiravir administration. The all-cause mortality 
rate was 11/102 (10.8%). The causes of death were exacerbation of pre- 
existing disease in seven patients, bacterial pneumonia in two patients, 
and exacerbation of COVID-19 in two patients. No molnupiravir-related 
deaths were observed. 
4.Discussion 
In the present study, we assessed the acceptability and safety of 
molnupiravir in older and younger patients. To date, few studies have 
evaluated the therapeutic effects of molnupiravir in the real world 
[11–13]. In this context, our study was conducted in the real world and 
focused on older patients aged ≥80 years to examine the acceptability 
and safety of molnupiravir. Various problems have emerged in 
COVID-19 practice in developed countries owing to the ageing of the 
population, and Japan is no exception [14]. One of the problems asso-
ciated with an ageing population is the difficulty in using anti-COVID-19 
drugs. Recently, it has recently been reported that remdesivir can be 
used relatively safely in older patients [15]. Oral antiviral agents may 
play an important role in the process of COVID-19 becoming a common 
disease. Whether they can be safely used in older patients is of interest to 
healthcare professionals. In terms of acceptability, the older patients had 
more discontinuations and failed to complete the prescribed number of 
days of dosing; however, the difference was not statistically significant. Three patients discontinued molnupiravir owing to worsening 
COVID-19. 
In Japan, molnupiravir received regulatory approval in December 
2021 and was not in use until early 2022. This was a time when the 
Omicron variant was predominant and antibody preparations became 
less effective and were almost no longer used as a treatment. The 
concomitant use of antiviral drugs is not recommended, and no other 
antiviral drugs are used in combination. Steroids are also not recom -
mended for the treatment of mild disease. Therefore, only a few drugs 
were used in combination with molnupiravir during the study period. 
There was no significant difference in the occurrence of adverse

The study found that there were no significant differences in the occurrence of adverse events between the older and younger patients.

There was no significant difference in the occurrence of adverse 
events between older and younger patients. The main adverse events 
were diarrhoea, bone marrow suppression, and exacerbation of coex-
isting diseases, but there were no differences in the frequency of 
occurrence or severity of any of them. Notably, exacerbations of coex-
isting diseases were seen in seven patients, all of whom died. Exacer -
bations of COVID-19 were also seen in three patients, two of whom died. 
This may be because of the high number of patients with advanced-stage 
malignancies as comorbidities, many of whom were terminally ill. No 
deaths were directly associated with molnupiravir administration. Table 2

4All adverse events observed in this study were known adverse events 
described in the drug package insert, and no new adverse events were 
observed. 
Our study suggests that molnupiravir can be safely administered to 
patients aged ≥80 years. 
Many of the participants in the current study were hospitalised at the 
start of treatment, regardless of the severity of COVID-19. This is 
because of several reasons that are specific to Japan. At the time of this 
study, COVID-19 was a designated infectious disease, and, in principle, 
hospitalisation was promoted for the older individuals and those with 
underlying medical conditions. Our institution had a special ward 
dedicated to COVID-19 and provided medical care for hospitalised pa-
tients. Therefore, even patients with mild or moderate disease who were 
treated at our institution were, in principle, managed in hospital. 
Oral antivirals were approved based on clinical trials conducted 
before the outbreak of the Omicron variant. Therefore, there was a 
concern that these drugs would not be sufficiently effective in the 
mainstream Omicron variant epidemics. A recent study from Hong Kong 
showed that even in an Omicron variant epidemic, molnupiravir con-
tributes to a reduction in all-cause mortality and COVID-19 exacerba -
tions after hospitalisation [16]. Another real-world study reported that 
even during an outbreak of Omicron strains, molnupiravir reduced 
mortality, with the effect being particularly pronounced in patients aged 
≥80 years [13]. From these previous reports and our present study, it 
can be assumed that molnupiravir may be used for mild-to-moderate 
COVID-19, even in older patients. The pharmacokinetics and pharma -
codynamics of molnupiravir are not affected by renal or hepatic func-
tion, which makes it easy to use in older patients. 
This study had several limitations. Because this was a retrospective 
study conducted in a single medical centre, there may be gaps in the 
patient population compared with other regions and in the collection of 
data during the medical record review. In Japan, ritonavir-boosted 
nirmatrelvir and molnupiravir are drugs whose shipments are coordi -
nated by the national government, and there were strong restrictions on 
their prescription during the study period. Therefore, it was not always 
used as indicated in the guidelines. It is possible that the restricted 
shipments of molnupiravir have resulted in inequitable distribution of 
medications to older patients eligible to receive them, and preferential 
distribution of medications to patients in better condition with a greater 
potential to benefit. This may lead to an underestimation of 
molnupiravir-related adverse events. In addition, COVID-19 is an in-
fectious disease with ongoing treatment changes. Because treatment 
guidelines for COVID-19 changed over time, the recommendation for 
molnupiravir used differed over the course of the study period, and it is 
probable that different patients with the same severity of disease 
received different drugs at different times. The same drug may be used 
for different indications at different times; therefore, uniformity was not 
always maintained. This may have to an overestimation or underesti -
mation of the acceptability and safety. Nevertheless, this study provides 
valuable data concerning older patients in the real world. 
5.Conclusions 
In conclusion, molnupiravir treatment is acceptable and safe in older 
patients with COVID-19 aged ≥80 years. Molnupiravir is an acceptable 
drug for use in older patients with COVID-19. Funding statement

Abstract: Clinical features of COVID-19 are diverse, and a useful tool for predicting clinical outcomes
based on clinical characteristics of COVID-19 is needed. This study examined the laboratory values
and trends that inﬂuence mortality in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Data on hospitalised patients
enrolled in a registry study in Japan (COVID-19 Registry Japan) were obtained. Patients with records
on basic information, outcomes, and laboratory data on the day of admission (day 1) and day 8 were
included. In-hospital mortality was set as the outcome, and associated factors were identiﬁed by
multivariate analysis using the stepwise method. A total of 8860 hospitalised patients were included.
The group with lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels >222 IU/L on day 8 had a higher mortality rate
compared to the group with LDH levels 222 IU/L. Similar results were observed in subgroups
formed by age, body mass index (BMI), underlying disease, and mutation type, except for those aged
<50 years. When age, sex, BMI, underlying disease, and laboratory values on days 1 and 8 were tested
for factors strongly associated with in-hospital mortality, LDH on day 8 was most strongly associated
with mortality. LDH level on day 8 was the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality in hospitalised
COVID-19 patients, indicating its potential usefulness in post-treatment decision-making in severe
COVID-19 cases.

1. Introduction
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), an infectious disease caused by severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), has affected a large number of individu-
als and resulted in over six million deaths worldwide [ 1]. Proven-effective treatments have

decreased lymphocyte counts and elevated levels of enzymes, inﬂammatory markers, and
D-dimer [ 8,9]. Some previous studies have also focused on novel biomarkers, such as
soluble urokinase receptors and C-reactive protein isoforms [ 10,11]. Clinical prediction
tools combining these easily measurable but nonspeciﬁc laboratory markers have also been
proposed [ 12,13]. Although they are useful in estimating the risk of resistance to treatment
and mortality in COVID-19 patients, most are evaluated only during the initial visit or
on admission. The clinical course of COVID-19 is varied and long. Hence, evaluation of
laboratory values at the initial point may fail to identify patients with potentially poor
prognoses or overestimate the risk of patients who respond rapidly to initial treatment.
Focusing on peak laboratory values has been reported to improve the accuracy of predicting
death [ 14], but laboratory value trends vary from patient to patient and are difﬁcult to
apply in actual clinical scenarios. How changes in laboratory values over a short period of
time affect the prognosis of patients with COVID-19 is not well understood.
Serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are often elevated in patients with severe
COVID-19, reﬂecting extensive pulmonary damage [ 15]. Elevated serum LDH at initial
presentation has been shown to strongly inﬂuence progression to respiratory failure and
death; therefore, LDH level is regarded as a useful indicator to initiate close monitoring to
prevent poor outcomes in patients with COVID-19 [ 16–18]. Although critically ill patients
and those with fatal courses are known to have higher serum LDH levels over a long
clinical course [19], the prognostic impact of LDH level trends remains unknown.
In Japan, a large-scale registry study (COVID-19 REGISTRY JAPAN, COVIREGI-JP) is
underway to collect clinical information on COVID-19 patients from multiple centres [ 20].
Using this registry data, our study aimed to validate two-time point laboratory values
affecting mortality in hospitalised patients with COVID-19 and to ﬁnd a universal and
simple prognostic marker independent of broad patient status at admission.
2. Materials and Methods
2.1. Study Design and Participants
This was an observational study, and the participants were enrolled from medical
institutions participating in COVIREGI-JP . Criteria for enrolment in COVIREGI-JP were:
(1) positive SARS-CoV-2 test and (2) hospitalisation and treatment at a registered medical
institution. Study data were collected and managed using Research Electronic Data Capture
(REDCap), a secure, web-based data capture application hosted at the Joint Centre for
Researchers, Associates, and Clinicians (JCRAC) Data Centre of the National Centre for
Global Health and Medicine. We excluded patients who were transferred from other
hospitals since their progress from the start of the treatment was unknown.
2.2. Study Period
Hospitalised patients enrolled between 20 March 2020 and 30 June 2021 were included
in the study. Owing to the revision of COVIREGI-JP case registration form, the period after
July 2022 was excluded since registration of post-hospitalisation laboratory data was no
longer required after that date.
2.3. Data Collection
Demographic characteristics (age, sex) and clinical data (body mass index [BMI], comor-
bidities, laboratory data, and in-hospital death) were collected. The date of admission was
defined as day 1, according to the data entry rules of COVIREGI-JP . In accordance with the
COVIREGI-JP data entry regulations, laboratory data collected on days 0–3 were pooled and
registered as day 1, while those collected on days 7–9 were pooled and registered as day 8. Day

entered with these data and were therefore excluded from this study . Although the reference
values for laboratory data differ depending on the facility and measuring instruments, the
reference value set at Hokkaido University Hospital was adopted in this study. A value of
222 IU/L was used as the upper limit for LDH. Cases in which this information was registered
without deficiencies were included in the analysis. Additional data on respiratory status at
the time of admission were collected.
2.4. Clinical Outcomes
Death during hospitalisation was set as the clinical outcome.
2.5. Statistical Analysis
We deﬁned LDH levels as low range ( 222 IU/L) and high range (>222 IU/L). The
eligible patients were classiﬁed into four groups based on their LDH results on day 1 and
day 8. The groups were as follows: (1) high–high (H–H), (2) high–low (H–L), (3) low–
high (L–H), and (4) low–low (L–L). For example, H–L group described patients who had
an LDH level trend within the elevated range (>222 IU/L) on day 1 and then the low
range ( 222 IU/L ) on day 8. Patient characteristics were compared between the groups.
Continuous and categorical variables were presented as medians and interquartile ranges
(IQRs) and counts and proportions, respectively. Continuous and categorical variables were
analysed using the one-way analysis of variance and Pearson’s chi-square, respectively.
We compared the in-hospital mortality between the groups using descriptive statistics.
Additionally, we conducted subgroup analyses stratiﬁed by sex, BMI (<18.5, 18.5–24.9,
25–29.9, >30 kg/m2), age (<50, 50–59, 60–69, 70–79, >80 years), comorbidity (cardiovascu-
lar diseases, respiratory diseases, liver diseases, renal diseases, diabetes, neoplasms, and
cerebrovascular diseases), and variant strains of SARS-CoV-2 (alpha and delta). The alpha
cohort comprised patients diagnosed between 17 March 2020 and 31 March 2021, while the
delta cohort consisted of patients diagnosed between 1 April and 30 June 2021. Multivariate
binary logistic models were then produced using a forward–backward stepwise approach,
using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). The models were retained with the following
variables (age, sex, BMI, and comorbidities). To identify the prognostic impact of LDH
level trends, we analysed the data using three different timing-tested laboratory data. Each
model contained laboratory data obtained on days 1, 8, and both. Receiver operating char-
acteristic (ROC) curves were then generated, and the area under the receiver curves (AUCs)
were calculated separately for the models and LDH level on day 8 alone to determine
discrimination. Additionally, we calculated the sensitivity, speciﬁcity, positive predictive
value (PPV), and negative predictive value (NPV) at various cut-off points of LDH level on
day 8.
All cases with missing data for any of the selected covariates, except respiratory status
on admission, were excluded from the analysis. R software (version 3.5.1; R Foundation for
Statistical Computing, Vienna, Austria) was used for all statistical analyses. All conﬁdence
intervals (CIs) were set at 95%.
3. Results

20 March 2020 and 30 June 2022. Patients transferred from other hospitals were excluded.

higher mortality rate compared to the group with low LDH levels ( 222 IU/L) on day
1 (7.2 vs. 2.5%). Among patients with high LDH levels on day 1, a large difference in
mortality rate was observed between the H–H and H–L groups (9.4 vs. 0.7%) (Table 1,

group had a higher mortality rate than the L–L group (6.8 vs. 0.5%) (Table 1, Figure 2).
Subgroups were formed by sex, age, BMI, underlying diseases, and dominant strains of
SARS-CoV-2, and mortality rates of the four groups were compared based on LDH values.
In all subgroups, the mortality rates of H–H and L–H groups were higher compared to H–L
and L–L groups, except for the population aged <50 years (Figure 2).
Multivariate analysis using the stepwise method was performed to examine how each
factor affected in-hospital mortality and to calculate the best prediction model. First, patient
characteristics (age, sex, BMI, comorbidities) were set as fixed variables, and other variables
were selected from day 1 laboratory values using the stepwise method. The results showed
that lymphocyte fraction, platelet count, creatinine, CRP , and CK were independent prognostic
factors, while LDH was not chosen as the optimal variable (appendix, Table S1). In contrast,
when the prediction model was validated by employing laboratory values from both days
1 and 8, LDH levels on day 8 were selected as the variable with the strongest effect on death
among all the variables (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 1.006 [1.005–1.007], chi-squared value 250.747,
p< 0.001) (Table 2; appendix, Table S2). Other elements that were selected as the best model
for predicting mortality were lymphocyte fraction on day 8, CRP on day 8, platelet count
on day 8, creatinine on day 1, CK on day 8, and CRP on day 1 (adjusted OR [95% CI]: 0.893
[0.875–0.911], 1.018 [1.011–1.026], 0.998 [0.997–0.999], 1.098 [1.017–1.186], 1.000 [0.999–1.000],

It is challenging to establish an accurate and useful mortality prediction model for
COVID-19. While some patients with COVID-19 become severely ill within approximately
eight days of onset and critical or fatal by approximately 16 days, most only have mild
symptoms at the time of disease onset [ 15]. Even when pneumonia sets in and the disease
becomes severe, only a small percentage of cases are fatal, making it difﬁcult to estimate
the risk of dying early in the course of the disease or at the time of hospitalisation. Previous
studies have shown that evaluation of LDH and other laboratory values at the time of
admission can predict subsequent severity of illness and death among patients [ 16,17,21].
Contrarily, the results of our study indicated that serum LDH levels at the time of admission
had a limited impact on predicting patient mortality. In Japan, medical resources vary
from region to region, and the threshold for patient hospitalisation and time required for
admission also differs depending on the prevalence of COVID-19. Hospitalised COVID-19
patients were a heterogeneous population in terms of the time of onset and risk of severe
illness or death. The predictive model, which was calculated by combining a large amount
of clinical information, showed high predictive accuracy. However, it is a cumbersome
process and requires a special method for calculation [22,23].
In this study, we included laboratory data from approximately eight days after admis-
sion. Our ﬁndings showed that mortality prediction became more accurate by including
data from day 8 than using data from the day of admission and that the effect of LDH, in
particular, had a signiﬁcant impact on mortality. Considering the long course of severe to
critical COVID-19, prognosis prediction using day 8 laboratory data would be pragmatic.
A lower cut-off (222 IU/L) for day 8 LDH value may be useful in determining discharge
or early completion of treatment because the PPV for death is comparatively low for pa-
tients with low LDH levels. In contrast, a higher cut-off (LDH 444 IU/L) increased the
PPV for death. Thus, this factor can be considered when making an informed decision
regarding reconsideration of the treatment plan in patients who have a poor response to
initial treatment for COVID-19; any treatment changes should be made after obtaining
informed consent from the patient.
A noteworthy aspect of this study was the ﬁnding of the usefulness of test items that
can be measured universally, regardless of region or facility. In addition, the ROC curve for
predicting death based on LDH level on day 8 showed a high AUC without considering the
baseline characteristics and severity of COVID-19 at the time of admission. We also showed
that more accurate prognostic models could be constructed by incorporating age and
underlying disease, in addition to serum LDH levels on day 8. Nevertheless, the process
of checking a single LDH level after admission is simple and easy to perform in actual
clinical practice. It could provide universal beneﬁts independent of medical resources and
social environment.
LDH is a nonspeciﬁc enzyme which is elevated in malignancies, liver diseases, inter-
stitial pneumonia, and other infections [ 24–27]. Hence, some of the enrolled patients might
have had elevated LDH from the outset, reﬂecting an underlying disease; and deaths in the
group with elevated LDH from admission might have included a small number of deaths
due to the underlying condition. However, the fact that LDH on day 8 had a stronger effect 
Clinician's context: The clinician has a COVID-19 patient who has been admitted to the hospital and wants to know if there is a way to predict the patient's mortality risk.
","Can LDH levels predict mortality risk in COVID-19 patients?
 ","Yes, according to a study published in Viruses, LDH levels on day 8 after admission can predict poor outcomes for in-hospital mortality in COVID-19 patients. The ROC curve for predicting death with day 8 LDH values showed an AUC of 0.88, with high NPV at a cut-off value of 222 IU/L and high PPV at a cut-off value of 444 IU/L. LDH levels at the time of admission had a limited impact on predicting patient mortality. However, including laboratory data from approximately eight days after admission, particularly LDH levels, had a significant impact on mortality prediction. A lower cut-off (222 IU/L) for day 8 LDH value may be useful in determining discharge or early completion of treatment because the PPV for death is comparatively low for patients with low LDH levels. In contrast, a higher cut-off (LDH 444 IU/L) increased the PPV for death.",originaldoc/Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase Level One Week after Admission Is the Strongest Predictor of Prognosis of COVID-19 A Large Observational Study Using the COVID-19 Registry Japan.pdf	 page(9),"Yes, according to a large observational study using the COVID-19 Registry Japan, LDH levels on day 8 of hospitalization were found to be the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality in hospitalized COVID-19 patients.

"group with elevated LDH from admission might have included a small number of deaths
due to the underlying condition. However, the fact that LDH on day 8 had a stronger effect
on COVID-19 mortality than any other factor in the multivariate analysis suggests that
elevated LDH levels primarily reﬂect organ injury caused by COVID-19. COVID-19 causes
not only extensive pulmonary damage but also myocardial and microvascular damage,
both of which can result in LDH deviation [ 15,28,29]. Both conditions are complicated in
the severe phase of the disease and carry a high mortality rate. A signiﬁcant risk of death
with high serum LDH on day 8 may reﬂect the presence of these late complications.
Our study did not include treatment for COVID-19 in the analysis because the exact
timing of initiation of treatment or doses for medications such as steroids was not recorded 
The document fragment discusses the relationship between elevated LDH levels and COVID-19 mortality. Clinicians might be interested in understanding the significance of LDH levels in COVID-19 patients and how it relates to organ injury and mortality.
","Can elevated LDH levels in COVID-19 patients indicate organ injury and increase the risk of mortality?
 ","Yes, elevated LDH levels in COVID-19 patients can indicate organ injury caused by the virus, including pulmonary, myocardial, and microvascular damage. The study mentioned in the document fragment found that LDH levels on day 8 had a stronger effect on COVID-19 mortality than any other factor in the multivariate analysis. High serum LDH levels on day 8 may reflect the presence of late complications, which carry a high mortality rate. However, the study did not include treatment for COVID-19 in the analysis, so the exact relationship between LDH levels and mortality may be influenced by treatment.",originaldoc/Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase Level One Week after Admission Is the Strongest Predictor of Prognosis of COVID-19 A Large Observational Study Using the COVID-19 Registry Japan.pdf	 page(9),"Yes, elevated LDH levels in COVID-19 patients can indicate organ injury and increase the risk of mortality.

in several cases registered in the COVIREGI-JP . Steroids and immunosuppressive drugs
have been used in a substantial percentage of patients in clinical practice. This may reﬂect
that CRP levels on day 8 were not signiﬁcantly associated with death in our study, although
inﬂammatory reactions have been predictive of death in previous reports [ 9,30]. It is
possible that treatment for COVID-19 was also a signiﬁcant confounding factor for LDH.
However, in light of the results of this study, unlike the inﬂammatory response markers,
LDH may be a less modiﬁable factor in the treatment of COVID-19. This suggests that the
LDH level is probably the laboratory value that reﬂects the true response of COVID-19
pneumonia to treatment.
We found that the peripheral blood lymphocyte fraction on day 8 was the second
strongest predictor of mortality among the laboratory values after LDH. In severe cases of
COVID-19, viral attachment to lymphocytes, damage by inflammatory cytokines, migration,
and aggregation to lung tissue are the causes of persistent decline in peripheral blood lym-
phocytes [ 31]. Decreased peripheral blood lymphocyte counts in COVID-19 patients have
been widely reported as a risk factor for severe disease [ 9,13,31]. Our study showed that the
effect of COVID-19 on lymphocytes was not attenuated on day 8, indicating that lymphopenia
could be a major factor in predicting poor prognosis. Using the ratio of LDH to lymphocyte
count [ 32], as suggested by a previous study, devising a prediction model that combines
multiple laboratory values with strong influences may prove to be useful. However, in clinical
practice, where versatility and simplicity are required, there is no substitute for the utility of
a single LDH level measurement at one-week post-hospitalisation.
This study had several limitations. First, its retrospective, observational study design.
Second, the data registration of COVIREGI-JP is dependent on the voluntary effort of
participating centres, which may have led to a selection bias in the enrolled cases. Addi-
tionally, as the clinical outcome was deﬁned as death during hospitalisation, long-term
prognosis, such as death after transfer, was not considered. Some factors that could affect
outcomes, such as mutant strain and vaccination history, were not evaluated. Some of
the established predictors of COVID-19 severity, such as serum procalcitonin, ferritin, and
D-dimer, were not analysed due to the limited number of patients for whom data on these
items were entered. Furthermore, as indicated in the Materials and Methods section, there
were discrepancies in the timing of the measurement of the laboratory values collected
in this study. In addition, laboratory data other than day 1 (day 0–3) and day 8 (day 7–9)
have not been validated; therefore, the possibility that there were other laboratory values
and their timing that were optimal for prognostic prediction cannot be ruled out. Last, in
Japan, it is possible that a substantial number of severe disease cases that did not receive
ventilators or other treatment were included. Therefore, the impact of LDH on mortality
may have been overestimated.
5. Conclusions
We found that LDH levels on day 8 were the strongest predictor of in-hospital mortality
in hospitalised COVID-19 patients. Easily measured LDH after initial treatment of COVID-
19 is suggested to be of great help in medical care planning.

The document fragment discusses various studies related to COVID-19, including its association with coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation, the correlation between inflammatory markers and the severity of COVID-19, the alteration of peripheral lymphocyte subsets in COVID-19 pneumonia, and the efficacy of the lactate dehydrogenase (LDH)/lymphocyte ratio (LLR) in reducing the need for X-ray in pregnant patients with COVID-19.
","Can you tell me more about the relationship between COVID-19 and coagulopathy?
 ","According to a study published in the International Journal of Hematology, there is an association between COVID-19 and coagulopathy, which is a condition where the blood's ability to clot is impaired. The study also discusses disseminated intravascular coagulation, which is a severe form of coagulopathy that can occur in COVID-19 patients.",originaldoc/Serum Lactate Dehydrogenase Level One Week after Admission Is the Strongest Predictor of Prognosis of COVID-19 A Large Observational Study Using the COVID-19 Registry Japan.pdf	 page(12),"According to a study published in the International Journal of Hematology, COVID-19 can cause coagulopathy and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Elevated serum lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) levels are often seen in severe COVID-19 patients, reflecting extensive pulmonary damage. Elevated serum LDH at initial presentation has been shown to strongly influence progression to respiratory failure and death. However, the relationship between COVID-19 and coagulopathy is not well understood, and further research is needed to fully understand this relationship.",CORRECT
